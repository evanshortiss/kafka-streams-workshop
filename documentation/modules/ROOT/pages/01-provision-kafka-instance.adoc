As a developer of applications and services, you can use OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka to create and set up Kafka instances and connect your applications and services to these instances. Streams for Apache Kafka is a managed cloud service that enables you to add Kafka data-streaming functionality in your applications without having to install, configure, run, and maintain your own Kafka clusters.

. When the instance _Status_ is _Ready_, you can start using the Kafka instance. You can use the *Options* icon (three vertical dots) to view, connect to, or delete the instance as needed.

[NOTE]
====
Although you can see Kafka instances created by other users in your organization, you can't manage those instances. Only the user who creates an instance can edit or delete the instance, setup permissions and create or delete topics.
